## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- Flexbox
- Media queries
- Functions

### What I learned

- Learned how to replace the list item dots with .svg icons by using the css background-image attribute.

- Experimented with various positions to get the attribution comment in the correct location.

- Improved on skills with the @media query.

- Learned how to use the 'git rm <file>' and 'git rm --cached <file>' command to delete a document from github and the local repository.

- In the creation of this README file, I've learned how to create a table of contents, how to display different-sized headings, how to add a picture, and how to incorporate HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

```css
@media screen and (min-width: 535px);
```

Used the column-reverse attribute to ensure proper placement of the provided image and the form.

```css
.card {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column-reverse;
  padding: 0;
}
```

Learned to use both the 'hidden' element in HTML and 'display: none;' in CSS to accomplish the same thing.

```html
<div class="subscribedCard" hidden></div>
```

Used email input value validation for the first time.

```js
function validateEmail() {
  if (
    !emailInput.value.match(/^[A-Za-z\._\-0-9]*[@][A-Za-z]*[\.][a-z]{2,4}$/)
  ) {
    invalidEmailMsg.removeAttribute("hidden");
    emailInput.style.backgroundColor = "#FFCDD2";
  } else {
    signupCard.style.display = "none";
    subscribedCard.removeAttribute("hidden");
    emailInput.style.backgroundColor = "white";
    invalidEmailMsg.setAttribute("hidden", "");
  }
}
```

### Continued development

Readjusting the screen size results in some unwanted layouts so I want to improve on the @media.

I want to improve my project by using React
